Hi! I'm Michael, a fourth year Computer Science PhD student at MIT advised by [Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) and supported by an NSF fellowship. I'm currently working on program analysis for dynamic languages.. Previously, I was a security researcher at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I graduated with my undergraduate from Northeastern University in 2018.
