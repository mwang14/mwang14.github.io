My first post.

Finally decided to make a website, and looks like there's a blog that comes with it. Highly doubtful I'll consistently put in the effort to update this, but we'll see in the future. 

Would be cool if I did, maybe it would be like a diary. Potential topics I could write posts about are:

- Random books I read, either related to productivity/research or not.
- Research topics or general thoughts about grad school.
- Any cooking-related topics I find interesting.
